#Web Dev Test
Things to note, I did not use Bootstrap since this test would entirely be made of bootstrap components therefore,
it would simply just be the case of gluing them together. Therefore, I had decided to create the site entirely from scratch.
Definitely took longer than anticipated.

## Frameworks and Tools
- Vanilla JS for navigation bar.
- NodeJS for Gulp set up( with SASS ).
- Font Awesome for the icons.
- No use of React, Bootstrap, Angular etc.

## How To Run
1. npm i
2. npm start
